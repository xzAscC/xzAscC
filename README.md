# Hi, I'm Xudong Zhu 👋

PhD student at The Ohio State University working on understanding and controlling large language models.

## About Me

- I am a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at The Ohio State University.

- My research focuses on mechanistic interpretability, and sparse representations in LLMs.

- I study how internal representations encode concepts and how we can steer model behavior with interpretable directions.

- My goal is to make LLMs more transparent, controllable, and reliable.
