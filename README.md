PhD student at The Ohio State University working on understanding and controlling large language models. I also vibe code research prototypes, developer tools, and AI systems.

## About Me

- I am a PhD student in Computer Science & Engineering at The Ohio State University.

- My research focuses on mechanistic interpretability, and sparse representations in LLMs.

- I study how internal representations encode concepts and how we can steer model behavior with interpretable directions.

- My goal is to make LLMs more transparent, controllable, and reliable.

## Recent Projects

- Understanding Linear Steering (ongoing)  
  Investigating the geometry, linearity, and causal structure of steering directions in LLM representation space.

- AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404), [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EEs6I4cO7S)  
  Developed a principled proximal-gradient framework that unifies SAE variants (ReLU, JumpReLU, TopK) and reveals that non-negativity constraints prevent bidirectional feature representation. Proposed AbsTopK, a magnitude-based sparse operator that recovers complete semantic axes and improves interpretability and steering in LLMs.

- From Emergence to Control: Probing and Modulating Self-Reflection in Language Models  [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12217)  
  Showed that linear directions in representation space can enable and control self-reflection behavior in pretrained LLMs without finetuning.
